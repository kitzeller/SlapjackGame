# SlapjackGame Design Document
Terminal Card Game made for Kleiner Perkins Fellowship Application.


**1. Instructions for running your code and any tests you may have written**

**2. Rules for your card game, if not one of the three listed above**

The player to the left of the dealer goes first and play continues clockwise from there. In turn, each player takes the top card from his pile and places it, face up, in the middle of the table.

When moving a card from his pile to the middle of the table, each player should do so by turning the card away from himself. This ensures that the player does not see the card before his opponents have a chance to do the same. (The player should also turn the card quickly so that heâ€™s not giving himself a disadvantage.)

When the card placed in the middle of the table is a Jack, players race to be the first to slap a hand on top of the Jack. The first player to do so wins the entire pile of cards. That player collects the cards and adds them to his pile. He then shuffles the entire pile and sets it down in front of him.

There are a number of specific rules related to slapping:

- When more than one player slaps at a Jack, the player whose hand is lowest on the pile wins.
- When a player slaps any card other than a Jack, he gives one card from his own supply, face down, to the opponent who played the card that fooled him.
- When a player runs out of cards, he remains in the game until the next Jack is revealed. If the player with no cards is the first to slap the Jack, he wins the pile of cards and remains in the game. If he is not first, however, he is eliminated from the game.

**3. A brief explanation of your design choices and any data structures or algorithms that you implemented**

I decided to develop Slapjack.

**4. Choice of tooling (language, libraries, test runner, etc.) and rationale behind those choices**

I used Java and IntelliJ. I didn't use any libraries besides the standard java.util.* collections framework.
